create a module that talks with the API, and returns the data as objects

create a different module that takes in objects and uses them to create the menu items
this module will talk to the first module and progress the flow forward

PBS Module
-----------------------
get shows
get show episodes
get videos
get favorites
add favorite

this may have a state? so it will know where it is when it's asked for page 2?
or the Kodi side module will know where it is, and just ask the PBS module for the next dataset
